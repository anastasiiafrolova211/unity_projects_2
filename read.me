velocity parameters works with joystick not with W/S/A/D keyboard movement

all topic names come from Stonefish bluerov - except for camera output - for sanity of the project camera was done as Unity camera

will work as soon as you run simultaniously both unity and stonefish - was done to maximize simulation experience for working with real robot
